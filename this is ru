this is ru. I made this to prove to myself that a suitably configured Monaco would work better for me than what I am using now, namely, graphical Emacs. it doesn't do anything except let you edit a document. (to save the document into a file, you would first have to Ctrl-C copy it.) thus it is a sort of demo of Monaco.

how to install the demo: copy ./ somewhere. cd into the copy. run 'yarn install', wait a long time. (there is currently an install at /repos in git bash on mbec.)

how to run the demo. run 'yarn start', wait until it says 'compilation successful', visit http://localhost:8080/. if there is a blank page at that url, open Developer Tools (if using Chrome) and try to figure out what is wrong; at least read the text in the Console tab.

if you need to save space, you can delete the yarn.lock file. 'yarn install' will re-generate it, but will probably install newer versions of most of the packages, which might break something, but prol not.

I made this by modifying https://github.com/hwestphal/phaser-playground. since I had no interest in phaser (an environment for creating web-based games) I deleted most of the content of that repo (and most of its npm dependencies). I didn't know whether I should delete hwestphal's .editorconfig and .vscode, so if the experience of editing the repo is clumsy in some way, you might re-add them.
